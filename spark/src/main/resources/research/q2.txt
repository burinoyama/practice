Today, we welcome another fantastic team to the Elastic family.
We are joining forces with Insight.io,
creators of a modern source code search platform used by thousands of developers around the world.

At Elastic, we live and breathe search,
and we do so spending our days sifting through code,
both in our own repositories or those of other open source projects.
Needless to say,
we understand and appreciate the challenges arising in this modern era of code with deciphering context at scale.
Insight.io addressed these challenges by developing a semantic search and code intelligence solution,
that is both elegant and powerful. It also leverages Elasticsearch for many core features :)

When you think about it,
a growing portion of our collective work product today is in the form of software code, across many sectors:
health, financial, government, media, and more.
Technologies like code search offer a unique lens into the value that exists beyond the objects, named functions,
variables and constants that make up your codebase.
It helps you make sense of the business logic that is embedded deeply in your applications.
Programs are the core intellectual property of many organizations today,
and enabling our users to navigate and understand that information is an exciting opportunity for us.
We aim to make code search an indispensable tool for anyone:
from new hires trying to understand their new workspace to the most senior developers,
speeding up access to information and reducing work duplication.
